Design for a single cycle processor with the following:

- 16 registers with width of 16 bits each, initialized to 0
- memory size of 1024 * 16 bits, intialized according to mem.hex
- memory is word addressable (16 bits/2 bytes)
- 16 bit pc, initialized to 0 - only lower 10 bits used due to memory constraints
- 1 instruction ADD - 0001AAAABBBBTTTT 
    adds values in registers a and b and places in register t
