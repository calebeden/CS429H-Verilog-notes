Design for a single cycle processor with the following:

- 16 registers with width of 16 bits each, initialized to their number (e.g. r0 = 0, r1 = 1, ...)
- memory size of 1024 * 16 bits, intialized according to mem.hex
- memory is word addressable (16 bits/2 bytes)
- 16 bit pc, initialized to 0 - only lower 10 bits used due to memory constraints
- 1 instruction ADD - 0001AAAABBBBTTTT
    adds values in registers a and b and places in register t
- Any undefined opcode is a halt

Compile:
iverilog -o cpu cpu.v
Run:
./cpu
Debug in GTKWave:
gtkwave cpu.vcd
